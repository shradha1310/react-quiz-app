# Overview

The Quiz App is a React-based application developed to demonstrate the use of key React concepts such as:

useEffect: For managing side effects, such as fetching data or performing actions based on state or prop changes.

useCallback: To memoize functions and optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

useState: For managing local component state.

This app showcases a simple and interactive quiz interface where users can answer questions and view their scores.
